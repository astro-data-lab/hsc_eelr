The parent catalog is taken from Ai-Lei Sun's paper references.
It combines catalogs from 4 papers (all given as fits catalogs in this dir).
The output of the catalog matching is stored in parent.fits.
Matching them against the HSC (S18A, I think) full-depth, full-color footprint
yields the final list source_list.fits.
